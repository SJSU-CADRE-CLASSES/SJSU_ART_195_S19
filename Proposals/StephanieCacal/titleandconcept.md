INEXORABLE

German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, stated "Whoever fights with monsters should see to it that he does not become a monster in the process. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you." 

Humans beings are essentially intelligent creatures capable of doing and achieving many things. However, we are also complex species; often times unpredictable and self-centered. We are constantly morphing physically, mentally, and socially. Our ideas and morals change, as well as our perceptions of what is considered good and what is considered bad; never fully able to comprehend the many differences and conflicted minds that accumulate this world.

Humans are trapped in an endless gray cycle. Rejecting and fighting against those we identify as monsters and constantly struggling not to one day become those monsters. Never realizing, or even just denying the fact, that it is just so easy to already become said monsters in another's eyes.
