        "Chef at Sea," is a short film documentary of a retired culinary chef, Marc Ries, who cooks on a fishing boat out of Berkeley, California.As a chef who has retired, Chef Marc finds himself back in a galley kitchen cooking for anglers. In this personal narrative, Chef Marc tells his current and past story of his life as a chef on a boat.

  Shot on location on the Califonia Sportfishing Vessel. This film was shot in over a year time span. It took 3 total trips out to sea on the boat to obtain all the needed footage. The voyages out to sea were sometimes exhausting as the ocean conditions were cold and choppy. We would leave the dock by 6AM and not return to land until 4PM. The difficulty of filming on the boat was extraordinary as the vessel would always rock.
