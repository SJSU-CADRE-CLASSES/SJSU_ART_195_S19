         <h4><b>"Here represents a lesson I think we keep forgetting."</b></h4>
        <p>
             You know all those motivational speeches that tell you that “you can be whatever you want to be” or “just be yourself?” I’m sure we all had that talk. I am also sure that we all are at least aware of how hard it is to truly stay individualistic today without constantly falling into some social mentality. Trends, styles, crazes. How easy it is to for people fall back into this collective behavior just because everyone else has joined some bandwagon. It’s quite shocking at times to see how quickly someone can feel isolated or outcasted when they don’t follow along. It almost hurts as if it was attacking us directly at us. Perhaps the world might become more interesting if everyone was a little more unique. How we should break out of the mold that had been casted around us by sociality. If the sole reason is because of the bandwagon then we should ignore the social activity that hinder our individualism.  <br>

[IN/EX]ternal is based on previous project of mine called Protect which played with the ideal of protecting ourselves from external forces. Here, that idea has been expanded to present forces not just from external forces but from internal forces as well. A mix between social expectancy versus self-realization for example. The core represents the individual with some deformities to represent their uniqueness. The pieces around represent both the external attack and the release of the mold based on the suggested direction they are facing.

		This is essentially a continuation of my sculpture work Protection (seen above). Just like the previous work, there will be objects that acts like a shell surrounding a bright and “pure” core that will represent the core of a being or thing. The core itself will be 3D printed in mind to be transparent and hallow internally to allow the installation of LEDs. The objects surrounding the core will be sharp and angular. They will also be fashioned in a way that their suggested line follows towards or away from the core, depending on the audience’s perspective. Both the layers and core will be hanged individually from the ceiling to give the impression that everything is suspended in mid-air and that the objects are surrounding the core in all directions. </p>

         <p>
This setup is to play with the idea/perspective/mood between outburst and oppression (or explosion or implosion). How <b>external</b> forces or <b>internal</b> struggles suppress down on you and you need to break out of a mold explosively. The LEDs in the core, combined with the suggested lines of the objects surrounding it, will assist in setting the mood of the piece between a positive or negative mood (being attacked/oppressed and breaking out).

            The first prototypes done were the pieces that would surround and cover the overall area of the work. These piece shown on the left were made with corrugated plastic sheets that were then cutout into trianglar shaped piece and then warped, bended, and melted using a heat gun. The initial plan was to just use plastic sheets. However, I found that cardboard can also make dyamic edges and textures slighly as well. As such, Several pieces of cardboards will now be added into the mix. I initially stayed away from cardboard since previous experience found that they weren't so mendable without assistance but here they can help with contruction. Several more piece will be made and then they'll be painted with some browns, greys, and some clear finish to give a more warped metal debris.

         <p>As the core was suppose to represent the an individual while relating to evryone, I went for an overall sphere shaped with several "imperfections" of rising and concaving spots. It is later interized that said spots would help construct the suggested direction based on the elevation of those spots ( high spots for outward direction and the opposite). I printed two halfves of the core with a 3D printer using transparent PLA and made so the inside would be hallow to allow space for the neopixel strips inside. <br>
                   The electronics themselves is simply using a neopixel strip connect to an Ardunio Uno. The videos below show the elecronics using modifiled example sketches and a modiflied sketch generator provided online. They will then be balled up inside the core. For the lighting, I wanted it to presented bright and dark colors to represent a external force or internal force (social mentalilty vs self-realization) but since I wanted to include the shadows I went for the bright classic "good" green and "evil" purple. <br>
                   To have everything fit inside the core, I also printed a ball and drilled some holes so that the battery and Ardunio can hide the ball while the strip can wrap around the ouside.<br></p>
