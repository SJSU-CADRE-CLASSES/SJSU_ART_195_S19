Hey so I tried Wesley's obj files yet some reason they don't seem to work when importing to Maya. He couldn't figure out how to fix it so I decided to recreate my own.

Other than the two measurements on the diagram PDF we got, everything else was guess-work. 

Also included is a 5'x5'x5' box obj that, hopefully can be used as a reference of scale.
