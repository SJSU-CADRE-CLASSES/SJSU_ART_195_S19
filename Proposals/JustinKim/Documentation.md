the Idea has changed slightly yet again. As much as I would like to mkae it my victory/triumph, it didn't really make sense in the long run. The end of college is really just another stepping stone for whatever comes next so this work should be about advancing to the next step.
Potential new titles: advance, proceed, One step at a time, In my Sights. 
Mindful of material cost and scale\.
