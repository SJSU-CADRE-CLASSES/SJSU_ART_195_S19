Hey guys it's Wes follow this link to my Google drive and download a copy of the Hammer Theater Gallery Space .obj

I tried my best to make this to scale but the floorplan supplied by the theater ommitted some measurements... I just estimated on those based on the picture

no lights/textures

added doorways and tried to make them to scale

there is a model of a man included and he is scaled to be a little over 6 feet tall
