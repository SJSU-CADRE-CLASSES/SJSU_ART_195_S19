Come face to face with Olivia, this projection mapping piece will have you spend some time
          experiencing a moment of truth with a hidden illness. Olivia shows you her calm exterior that 
          is often the mask for this mental disorder. As the light flows down through her body you will 
          get an inside view of what anxiety and panic disorder can feel like to many suffering. People 
          with anxiety and panic disorder deal with a multitude of symptoms that are hidden to the outside 
          world through a calm demeanor. These symptoms can make simple everyday tasks near impossible 
          at times. Mental disorders can often be dismissed or stigmatized due to lack of knowledge. My
          hope is to bring awareness to anxiety and mental disorders in general.</p>
