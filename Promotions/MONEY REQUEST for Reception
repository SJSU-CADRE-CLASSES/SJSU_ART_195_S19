Hi guys, I will be managing the money for the reception.

Please chip in $10 for food. You can pay with CASH or to my VENMO @Jennifer-Cacal. If you pay with venmo, 
write 'BFA Food' in the note so I know what the money is for.
Please pay by April 17th, and let me know when you do so I can add your name to the list. Thank you!

People I received money from:
- Jennifer
- Don
- Nicole
- Wen Wen
- Stephanie
- Faustino
- Emily
- Emily 2
- Wesley
