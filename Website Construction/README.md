These are instructions on uploading your documentation.

* Create your own html page with your artist statement 
* If you have your own css styling, you can upload to the css folder
* If you're fine with website default styling, you can just upload your html page
* For photos you can make your own folder for images and videos in the "assets folder"
* Indicate where your photos go in the html page

How to name stuff

* NAME YOUR HTML FILE THIS WAY: "YourName.html"
