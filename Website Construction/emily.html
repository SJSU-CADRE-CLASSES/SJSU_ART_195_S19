     Our eyes act like cameras constantly feeding images to our brain. I believe screens are intertwined with us biologically because it can affect how we dream. If someone grew up watching Black and White television, there is a likelihood they dream in black and white. I grew up with colored screens that I have never dreamt in black and white. The disparity between generations about screen exposure inspired to create this video piece.
I made a reference to the popular film stock made by Kodak. To me, film is a relic and representative of nostalgia for the past. A montage of abstract graphics and eyes fill the small frame. Many flashes happen throughout the video that show snippets of various eyes. I hope that viewers feel a sense of familarity from it.
