Hey guys it's Wes follow this link to my Google drive and download a copy of the Hammer Theater Gallery Space .obj

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DaFwkpnYcrdrQGiLaqXv2mH-jTaRVnVP?usp=sharing

I tried my best to make this to scale but the floorplan supplied by the theater ommitted some measurements... I just estimated on those based on the picture

no lights/textures

added doorways and tried to make them to scale

there is a model of a man included and he is scaled to be a little over 6 feet tall


this seems to work fine for me downloading it and opening in the program I use. let me know if it doesn't work for you for any reason
