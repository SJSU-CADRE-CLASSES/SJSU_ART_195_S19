        Initially, I decided to base my Digital Media Artwork on a Virtual Reality Platform that will interact with the physical world. Using a powerful technology such as VR encourages to change our lives unlike any other. 
<br>
<br>
By artificially stimulating our senses, our bodies become tricked into accepting another version of reality. VR is like a waking dream that could take place in a magical cartoon-like world or could transport us to another part of the Earth or universe. We can socialize with people inside of new worlds, which could be real or artificial. That is why I came up with an idea of using physical sound such as clapping, talking, screaming, yelling that will be responsive to explosive particles in the virtual world. Hence, people can express themselves through noises or however they want and observe their reactions exploding in colored particles in a virtual platform.
<br>
<br>
I am also going to use a combination of video and audio, filling a single personâ€™s field of sensation, that works with their perceptual process to give the illusion of being in a computer generated, and yet believable, reality. There will be a physical canvas as part of the installations as well as in the virtual world. Once someone gets close to the VR headset, they will actually have the physical canvas facing them and once they wear the VR headset, the would enter the virtual will in which the same canvas is then virtual and animated.
<br>
<br>
As the people move their head around the visuals (and sometimes the audio) changes naturally to give the sense of being in a real world. Quixotic VR will provide physical feedback through touch surfaces, and sound interfaces allowing objects in the virtual world to be manipulated, and haptic feedback between manipulated objects and the body of the participant. VR experiences are usually undertaken individually, however in the future social VR will be more popular, with people able to interact with each other.

			  1. Stimulate VR based activity and the formation of a network of faculty members in the Art department of San Jose State University as well as Mercury News and other Bay Area News department - a press release and a group email has been created and sent.

    2. Buying and preparation of equipment. Create a physical installation version of the VR Artwork to create an illusionistic way of looking at both the physical and virtual installation.

3. Create a virtual environment and objects such as the canvas, the face, the chains, and LED Lights.
