          Recently I have been interested in the duality of the mental and the physical.
          <br>
          How does a physical experience trigger a mental experience?
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          I wanted to explore what connects and separates the two, and I began with the idea of discovery.
          <br>
          <br>
          
          Could discovering a miracle cause a rebirth of the psyche?
          <br>
          
          <br>
          I have been meditating over the infinite possibilities that could exist somewhere in the far reaches of the universe, and the impact that it would have on the mind to witness a true phenomenon that invalidated all its preceding understanding.
          <br>
          
          <br>
          To the mind it would feel like the physical world had changed, but it would just be the understanding of reality that had grown.
          <br>
          
          <br>
          This belittling expansion of the mind to forms unfathomable to us in the present is an idea that I wonder about. 
          <br>
          <br>          
          <br>
          In this body of work, I wanted to explore the concept of physical and mental migration. 
          <br>
          
          <br>
          How are moving to a new physical place and moving to a new mentality similar?
          <br>
          
          <br>
          Can the mind circumvent an idea similarly to the body physically circumventing an object in space?
          <br>
          
          <br>
          If physical migration leaves a physical footprint, does mental migration leave a mental footprint?
          <br>
          
          <br>
          Through considering the perspectives of others we can expand our consciousness to become bigger than ourselves.
          <br>
          <br>
                    
          <br>
          I was also captivated by water and the idea of its surface representing a permeable layer separating the physical and mental. 
          <br>
          
          <br>
          Our idea of portals would theoretically allow movement through physical reality but what if portals could be doors into the mind?
          <br>
          
          <br>
          <br>
          Through this exhibition I wanted to create a physical experience and, in turn, a mental experience for my audience.
          <br>
          
          <br>
          My hope is that the physical action of being exposed to these questions provokes a mental reaction of new self-reflection and curiosity about the world around you.
