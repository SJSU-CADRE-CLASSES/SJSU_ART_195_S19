   <h1>Migration of Entangled Ghosts</h1>
    <br>
      <h2>Wen Wen</h2>
       <br>
  <p>The focus of Migration of Entangled Ghosts lies in the intersection of survival
between marine organisms and plastics, merging together inanimate pollutants and
lives. Her work explores the future that may arise through the combining of
sculpture and technology, creating a visual experience of two extremely
contradictory substances in environmental ocean problems that are a serious
concern yet commonly ignored. Confronting viewers with the various properties of
plastic, Wen creates the image of a floating ghost migration that is restricted to
corrosion like a light-weighted toxic presence waving in transparency. Her work is
both an imagination and a reality which directs viewers to the sadness caused by
the plastic that she found, evoking her audience to realize their participation in this
entanglement. In reality, this piece conveys to ordinary people that they themselves
are the ghosts entangled. </p>
