    <b>BFA PROPOSAL</b>

Medium: Interactive Painting and Projection Mapping
Programs: Painttool SAI, Adobe Illustrator, PremierePro, After Effects, Vpt8, MspMax, MadMapper

I am currently working on creating a two parter piece using conductive paint and projection mapping. The painting is a 36x48 inch canvas 
with a figured painted onto it using conductive paint. The pain, when touched, will produce a poem spoken by me.If not touched, the sound 
will produce verses from Friedrich Nietzsche spoken by me. Along with the conductive paint on the canvas, I will also projection map small
animations on the the white space of the canvas.

 Materials:
-conductive paint
-36x48” canvas
-paint brushes and pallet knife
-mini projector
-pc and usb/hdmi cables 
-drawing tablet 
    
<b>Working Title: “INEXORABLE”</b>
German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, stated "Whoever fights with monsters should see to it that he does not become a monster in the 
process. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you."

Humans beings are essentially intelligent creatures capable of doing and achieving many things. However, we are also complex species; 
often times unpredictable and self-centered. We are constantly morphing physically, mentally, and socially. Our ideas and morals change, 
as well as our perceptions of what is considered good and what is considered bad; never fully able to comprehend the many differences and 
conflicted minds that accumulate this world.Humans are trapped in an endless gray cycle. Rejecting and fighting against those we identify 
as monsters and constantly struggling not to one day become those monsters. Never realizing, or even just denying the fact, that it is 
just so easy to already become said monsters in another's eyes.
