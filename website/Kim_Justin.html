         <h3>  <b>Proposal</b></h3>
		<p>
		This is essentially a continuation of my sculpture work Protection (on bottom right image). Just like the previous work, there will be objects that acts like a shell surrounding a bright and “pure” core that will represent the core of a being or thing. The core itself (preferably the size will be 5 or more inches) will be 3D printed in mind to be transparent and hallow internally to allow the installation of LEDs. The objects surrounding the core will be sharp and angular. They will also be fashioned in a way that their suggested line follows towards or away from the core, depending on the audience’s perspective. Both the layers and core will be hanged individually from the ceiling to give the impression that everything is suspended in mid-air and that the objects are surrounding the core in all directions. </p>
            <p>
This setup is to play with the idea/perspective/mood between outburst and oppression (or explosion or implosion). How <b>external</b> forces or <b>internal</b> struggles suppress down on you and you need to break out of a mold explosively. The LEDs in the core, combined with the suggested lines of the objects surrounding it, will assist in setting the mood of the piece between a positive or negative mood (being attacked/oppressed and breaking out).

             Cornelia Parker relates to my work based on the visual aspects and construction of her work  <i>The Story of Cold Dark Matter</i>. Visually because she too created a mid-explosion and constructively because while creating this work she is constantly mindful not only of the pieces she suspends in midair but also the space in between them. She even makes note of the idea of the explosion too saying, <br><br>
              <i>“As the objects were suspended one by one, they began to lose their aura of death and appeared reanimated, in limbo.  I operate very often in these ‘frozen moments’ where there’s been lots of action but this a sort of quiet corner of that…So it’s not the explosion, it’s more the contemplation, you know, the quiet contemplation of these things in the air and because the things are in the air, they haven’t got the pathos they would have had if they were on the ground. It takes away that kind of pathos, which is there when you see a lot of the debris on the ground after an explosion, well put it back in the air and it’s still got some life.” </i> <br><br>
As such I believe her method of contruction will beneifit myself in constructing my Persistence.

              Do-Ho Suh would relate here based on his with work with <i>Floor</i>. In simplest terms, it can be considered that this work is built from the “one vs many” ideal that came to Suh regarding his identity as a Korean American after the riots that happen in LA. I wanted to do something similar here with Persistence, the idea of one individual (the core) against a collective (the debris) in two situations both visually similar (attack and explosion). The one vs many ideal will help the audience understand that my work is to represent individuality against a collective or social reforms both internally and externally.

            What I take from Sandy Skoglund’s work such as <i>Cold War and Radioactive cats</i> is her use of suggestive and directional lines that all collectively point to a single focal point, yet she does it in a way that the objects that create said lines complement the composition and makes the entire work interesting instead of just the focal point. Suggested lines are going to be an important factor in my work since I’ll need to suggest lines that going both inward and outward motion to portray my “Internal or External” ideal.

             Like Cornelia Parker, Damian Ortega’s work with <i>Controller of the Universe</i> also includes a mid-explosion suspended with the use of wire and a theater grid. However, the biggest difference here that I take inspiration from is that the tools that Ortega uses is presented with suggested lines that project outwards. He positioned them this way to, “transform the visitor’s own ideas about what tools are and mean.” I want to construct my project so that the audience will look past the straightforward idea of an explosion and understand that this is also an idea of individuality.

          <h5>Small Scale</h5>
          Since this was going to be a large scale installation in the Black Gallery, creating a small scale version was probably best. While the small scale constructed here doesn't exactly protray the exact presentation of the final work, This was enough to understand the interactions between each piece in their relative placement as well as getting an idea of other elements including lighting (video test below).

                  The first prototypes done were the pieces that would surround and cover the overall area of the work. These piece shown on the left were made with corrugated plastic sheets that were then cutout into trianglar shaped piece and then warped, bended, and melted using a heat gun. The initial plan was to just use plastic sheets. However, I found that cardboard can also make dyamic edges and textures slighly as well. As such, Several pieces of cardboards will now be added into the mix. I initially stayed away from cardboard since previous experience found that they weren't so mendable without assistance but here they can help with contruction. Several more piece will be made and then they'll be painted with some browns, greys, and some clear finish to give a more warped metal debris.

                  This was definitely the second most time-consuming part on constructing the work since I had to individualy take the time to mend each piece with the heat gun so that they look like a finished piece and not some rush piece of plastic. They were then primed and painted with some grey and brown spray paint to give it some color.

                  Since I wasn't allowed to hang objects from the ceiling in the Black Gallery, I had to create a series of suspension lines to hang everything on. Each line I made consisted of several passes of monofilament fishing wire that were then spun around with a electric drill and a custom rig.

                  As the core was suppose to represent the an individual while relating to evryone, I went for an overall sphere shaped with several "imperfections" of rising and concaving spots. It is later interized that said spots would help construct the suggested direction based on the elevation of those spots ( high spots for outward direction and the opposite). I printed two halfves of the core with a 3D printer using transparent PLA and made so the inside would be hallow to allow space for the neopixel strips inside. <br>
                   The electronics themselves is simply using a neopixel strip connect to an Ardunio Uno. The videos below show the elecronics using modifiled example sketches and a modiflied sketch generator provided online. They will then be balled up inside the core. For the lighting, I wanted it to presented bright and dark colors to represent a external force or internal force (social mentalilty vs self-realization) but since I wanted to include the shadows I went for the bright classic "good" green and "evil" purple. <br>
                   To have everything fit inside the core, I also printed a ball and drilled some holes so that the battery and Ardunio can hide the ball while the strip can wrap around the ouside.<br>

            <h5>Construction</h5>
          <p> This was the most time-consuming part of the whole thing as it took roughly two days total to set everything up and have it ready. Fortunatly, my mother had also asissted me in the installation as well. I first started with installing the suspension line using the ledges that were present on the sides of the space. Next came installing the core, which was the simpliest to do, taping the cable it was hanging from to the line then had it run along the line to the wall and down to an avaible outlet. The worst part came with hanging all the fragmentation pieces. Each piece was tied with a single wire from two separate points on each piece which were then tied to two separate lines.

          <P><b>Here represents a lesson I think we keep forgetting.</b> <br>
You know all those motivational speeches that tell you that “you can be whatever you want to be” or “just be yourself?” I’m sure we all had that talk. I am also sure that we all are at least aware of how hard it is to truly stay individualistic today without constantly falling into some social mentality. Trends, styles, crazes. How easy it is for people to fall back into this collective behavior just because everyone else has joined some bandwagon. It’s quite shocking at times to see how quickly someone can feel isolated or outcasted when they don’t follow along. It almost hurts as if it was attacking us directly at us. Perhaps the world might become more interesting if everyone was a little more unique. How we should break out of the mold that had been casted around us by sociality. If the sole reason is because of the bandwagon then we should ignore the social activity that hinder our individualism.  
<br>
<b>[IN/EX]ternal</b> is based on previous project of mine called Protect which played with the ideal of protecting ourselves from external forces. Here, that idea has been expanded to present forces not just from external forces but from internal forces as well. A mix between social expectancy versus self-realization for example. The core represents the individual with some deformities to represent their uniqueness. The pieces around represent both the external attack and the release of the mold based on the suggested direction they are facing.
