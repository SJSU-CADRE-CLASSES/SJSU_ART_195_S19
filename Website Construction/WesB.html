        	Recently I have been interested in the duality of the mental and the physical.
        	<br>
        	How does a physical experience trigger a mental experience?
        	<br>
        	<br>
        	<br>
        	
        	I wanted to explore what connects and separates the two, and I began with the idea of discovery.
        	<br>
        	<br>
        	
        	Could discovering a miracle cause a rebirth of the psyche?
        	<br>
        	
        	<br>
        	I have been meditating over the infinite possibilities that could exist somewhere in the far reaches of the universe, and the impact that it would have on the mind to witness a true phenomenon that invalidated all its preceding understanding.
        	<br>
        	
        	<br>
        	To the mind it would feel like the physical world had changed, but it would just be the understanding of reality that had grown.
        	<br>
        	
        	<br>
        	This belittling expansion of the mind to forms unfathomable to us in the present is an idea that I wonder about. 
        	<br>
        	<br>        	
        	<br>
        	In this body of work, I wanted to explore the concept of physical and mental migration. 
        	<br>
        	
        	<br>
        	How are moving to a new physical place and moving to a new mentality similar?
        	<br>
        	
        	<br>
        	Can the mind circumvent an idea similarly to the body physically circumventing an object in space?
        	<br>
        	
        	<br>
        	If physical migration leaves a physical footprint, does mental migration leave a mental footprint?
        	<br>
        	
        	<br>
        	Through considering the perspectives of others we can expand our consciousness to become bigger than ourselves.
        	<br>
        	<br>
        	        	
        	<br>
        	I was also captivated by water and the idea of its surface representing a permeable layer separating the physical and mental. 
        	<br>
        	
        	<br>
        	Our idea of portals would theoretically allow movement through physical reality but what if portals could be doors into the mind?
        	<br>
        	
        	<br>
        	<br>
        	Through this exhibition I wanted to create a physical experience and, in turn, a mental experience for my audience.
        	<br>
        	
        	<br>
        	My hope is that the physical action of being exposed to these questions provokes a mental reaction of new self-reflection and curiosity about the world around you.
        	<br>
        	
        	<br>
